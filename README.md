Idle Steam Played Time
======================

The repository is a modification of the original [Idle Master](https://github.com/jshackles/idle_master). 

You can idle multiple games simultaneously:
* A game with more played time will have a higher probability to be selected. 
* A game will have a higher probability to be selected if the corresponding `favor` checkbox is checked. 
* A game will never be selected if the `never` checkbox is checked. (And `never` has higher priority than `favor`)
* You can manually start or stop an idle by change the state of the corresponding `idle` checkbox. (Even if `never` is checked)

You can find the lastest built files in [releases](https://github.com/XGG-Studio/Idle-Steam-Played-Time/releases) page.
