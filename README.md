Idle Steam Played Time
======================

The repository is a modification of the original [Idle Master](https://github.com/jshackles/idle_master). You can idle multiple games simultaneously, a game with more played time will have a higher probability to be idled. The game will have a higher probability to be selected if the corresponding `favor` checkbox is checked, while it will never be selected if the `never` checkbox is checked.

You can find the lastest built files in the [release](https://github.com/XGG-Studio/Idle-Steam-Played-Time/releases) page.
