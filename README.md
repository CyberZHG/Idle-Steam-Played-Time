Idle Master 2400
================

The repository is a modification of the original [Idle Master](https://github.com/jshackles/idle_master). You can idle multiple games simultaneously, a game with more played time will have a higher probability to be idled.

You can download the single compiled exe [here](https://github.com/XGG-Studio/idle_master_2400/releases/download/v1.4/IdleMaster2400.exe).
